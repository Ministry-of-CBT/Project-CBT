## Getting Started

With the world at permanent nighttime with hardcore darkness you must find a glowing flower from Silent's Gems as it is the only natural light source spawning. If your surroundings doesn't have one, you are either fucked or you need to travel long way before finding a glowing flower, because why? Frick you I SLAPPED TFC, SCAPE AND RUN PARASITES, AND NOW ZOMBIE AWARENESS JUST TO DESTROY YOUR SANITY! RUN RUN RUN IF YOU SEE ANY OF THE HOSTILE MOBS, NO ONE NOT EVEN GREG CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE! What did you expect this is a modpack designed for pure c*ck and ball torture

## Lore

Summary: In the world of Cock and Ball Touhouture: NuclearGreg Horizons, where technology rules supreme., an unexpected portal opens, connecting the advanced industrial realm to the mystical land of Gensokyo. As the worlds collide, the characters from Gensokyo find themselves thrust into a spellbinding adventure, facing challenges they've never imagined. Together with the Touhou Project heroines, they must learn to harness the power of both science and magic to preserve the balance between the two worlds and overcome a common threat that could endanger them all.

Now you, the player are one of the characters stuck in this unfamilliar world.

So what do you do? WING IT. 

Gregification Imminent.
